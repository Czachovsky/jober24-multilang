If our company is required to process personal data due to a legal obligation, e.g. to fulfill tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person. Such situations may occur, for example, if an accident occurs in our company and a doctor, hospital or other entity needs to be provided with necessary data such as name, age, health insurance details or other data vital to life. Then the processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing operations may be based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Processing operations that are not covered by any of the above legal bases are based on this legal basis if the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail. Processing is particularly permitted because it has been explicitly indicated by the European legislator. In this regard, it was considered that a legitimate interest may exist if the data subject is a customer of the data controller (recital 47 para. 2 GDPR)."
